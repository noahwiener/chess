# Chess

This fully interactive, pure-ruby chess game runs in the terminal.  Color cues in the game not only illuminate the board, but also show players where they can move and what pieces they can take.  The game takes advantage of modules, inheritance, and manipulation of user input for a great chess experience.

To play the game, clone this repo, navigate to the project folder, and enter <code>ruby game.rb<code>
